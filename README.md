# UltraGameJam_DevilsRevenge
A quickly put together bullet-hell top-down shooter. Lots of functionality and expandability but scuffed due to limited time for polish

### Use of data structures to make life easier, more functionality and expandability
- Variable based bullet patterns, spread, knockback, damage
- Weapon system that enables levelling with custom patterns, sprites and weapon xp
- Wave data structure, waves can be adjusted easily and enemies drag and dropped in
- Prefab-able enemies with their own data structure for health and other behaviour, combined with the above structure

### Limited time
- Utilised data structures where possible to minimise time needed to add more levels and some difficulty progression
- All assets home-made (Minus some sound effects)
- Particle effects used for polish where possible
- Some screen-size portability was implemented but not perfect

## If iterated on in the future I'd change / update
- Sprites and artstyle
- Extra touches (such as animation) and more time on particle/sound effects
- Cleaner menu and level select
- More gameplay features like selective penetration
- Proper level design / more complete procedural levels
